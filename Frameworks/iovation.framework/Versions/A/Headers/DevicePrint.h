 * @brief iovation device inspector SDK for iOS
 *
 * iovation ReputationManager™ identifies devices through information collected
 * by this SDK, which runs on an end user’s iOS device. DevicePrint
 * schedules and runs tasks in an asynchronous queue that collect the data
 * necessary to generate a blackbox containing details about the device. This
 * blackbox must then be transmitted to your servers to be used in a reputation
 * check (for example a @p CheckTransactionDetails call).
 *
 * @version 4.2.0
